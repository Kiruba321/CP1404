# Practical Repository - README

## Introduction

Welcome to the practicals repository! This is where I've stored all the practical exercises and projects completed during the CP1404 course. I'm Kirubanithi Sornamoorthy, the one responsible for this repository.

## Lessons on "Clean Code"

Throughout this subject, I've gained valuable insights into writing clean and maintainable code. Here are three main lessons that stuck with me:

1. ### Meaningful Variable and Function Names
   Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions enhances the readability of the code. 

2. ### Proper Code Indentation and Formatting
   Consistent indentation and formatting of code significantly improve code readability. 

3. ### Modularization and Code Reusability
   Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, modular functions improves code maintainability.
